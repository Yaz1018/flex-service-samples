[FlexServices] are microservices that can be used for data integrations or business logic within the [Kinvey mBaas](https://www.kinvey.com/). There are three types of FlexServices:

* **FlexData** for data integrations.
* **FlexAuth** for authentication integrations.
* **FlexFunctions** for business logic (along the lines of what is often called _serverless_). These can be used as custom endpoints, which can be called directly via REST or the Kinvey SDK, or can be added as business logic during the [collection hook pipeline](https://devcenter.kinvey.com/html5/reference/business-logic/reference.html#CollectionHookPipeline).

This repository contains a number of examples of FlexServices. The goal is to eventually offer a variety of examples of all the various types of FlexServices.
